## Tech Stack
### Client
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)

At first, I wanted to use Shadcn UI for the pre-built components, but because it is built with TypeScript, I had some trouble setting it up and keeping things compatible. As a result, I decided to use a library more compatible with React-Vite and JavaScript;

### Server
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/flask-%23000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=flask&logoColor=white)
![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/sqlite-%2307405e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)
![Gemini API](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gemini%20API-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=google&logoColor=white)

Given the scope of the project (which is [small-medium size](https://sqlite.org/features.html)), I decided to use a lightweight framework like Flask and a serverless database like SQLite. I am most comfortable with Python, so I chose it as the language for the backend. When the project scales, I'm considering using a more scalable database like PostgreSQL and the FastAPI framework.

## Problem Statement
We generate data every day - the data that helps us understand our behaviors and challenges better. I find the available task management tool lacking in the data collection and experimentation aspect. My goal with Flow is to address some problems I encounter when it comes to managing tasks or productivity. Because I believe it is such a waste not to make use of our daily data to become better.
- **Poor time estimation** of how long a task would take (either overestimating easy tasks or underestimating difficult tasks)
- **Lack of an analytics space** to extract the patterns based on past data (planned vs actual duration to complete a task, the mental state when doing the task, and the detailed reflection after completing the task)
- **Lack of a tool to experiment** with different techniques or methods to confirm whether a change in behavior is effective or not.

## Features
- CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete projects, categories, lists, and tasks.
- Analytics: Users can retrieve data to see statistics about their completion rate, estimation accuracy, etc., by category and by project.
- Experiments: Users can set up experiments to apply to certain types of tasks and measure the impact.

## Backend

### Folder Structure (Application Factory Pattern)
The backend is structured using the Application Factory Pattern, with the API layer (defining the routes) and services layer (defining the business logic and how to interact with the database tables)

## 🏗️ Under Development
- Analytics dashboard to show statistics about total completed tasks, accuracy estimation rate, time spent on different types of tasks, and AI-powered insights generation
- Experiments that allow users to conduct productivity-related experiments such as time estimation multiplier, practice to improve mental state.
