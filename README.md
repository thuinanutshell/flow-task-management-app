# Spark - Task Management App

Spark is a task management app that can help you organize your tasks every day. I call it Spark because I believe that things that you do every day (however small they are), if they are well-organized and intentional, will spark some inspiration to help you move forward. This is an ongoing project, and I hope to enhance and add more features weekly. I used Flask for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Core Functionalities
- [ ] Organize tasks into folders
- [ ] Track progress of task completion
- [ ] Pomodoro for focused session
